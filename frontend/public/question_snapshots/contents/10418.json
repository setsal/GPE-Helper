It's a cute little game which comes within a certain Operating System which name we can't really remember. Well, the goal of the game is to find where are all the mines within a MxN field. To help you, the game shows a number in a square which tells you how many mines there are adjacent to that square. For instance, supose the following 4x4 field with 2 mines (which are represented by an * character):</p>&#13;\n<pre>*...&#13;\n....&#13;\n.*..&#13;\n....&#13;\n</pre>&#13;\n<p>If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers described above, we would end up with:</p>&#13;\n<pre>*100&#13;\n2210&#13;\n1*10&#13;\n1110&#13;\n</pre>&#13;\n<p>As you may have already noticed, each square may have at most 8 adjacent squares.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Input</h3><p>The input will consist of an arbitrary number of fields. The first line of each field contains two integers n and m (0 &lt; n,m &lt;= 100) which stands for the number of lines and columns of the field respectively. The next n lines contains exactly m characters and represent the field. Each safe square is represented by an \".\" character (without the quotes) and each mine square is represented by an \"*\" character (also without the quotes). The first field line where n = m = 0 represents the end of input and should not be processed.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Output</h3><p>For each field, you must print the following message in a line alone:</p>&#13;\n<pre>Field #x:</pre>&#13;\n<p>Where x stands for the number of the field (starting from 1). The next n lines should contain the field with the \".\" characters replaced by the number of adjacent mines to that square. There must be an empty line between field outputs.</p><hr /><div id=\"sampleinputoutput\"><table class=\"inputoutput\"><tr><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Input</h3></td><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Output</h3></td></tr><tr></tr><tr class=\"inputoutput\"><td class=\"inputoutput\" valign=\"top\"><pre class=\"sampleio\">4 4&#13;\n*...&#13;\n....&#13;\n.*..&#13;\n....&#13;\n3 5&#13;\n**...&#13;\n.....&#13;\n.*...&#13;\n0 0&#13;\n</pre></td><td class=\"inputoutput\" valign=\"top\"><pre class=\"sampleio\">Field #1:&#13;\n*100&#13;\n2210&#13;\n1*10&#13;\n1110&#13;\n&#13;\nField #2:&#13;\n**100&#13;\n33200&#13;\n1*100&#13;\n</pre></td></tr></table></div><hr /><table><tr><td>Source: </td><td>http://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/101/10189.html</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td></td></tr></table></div></body>\n</html><html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></html>"}
