He justified his observations in a book titled <em>Human behavior and the principle of least effort</em> p<img src=\"/question_snapshots/assets/14894290dafd91368ca707be7e75adb7.gif\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" />ublished in 1949. While Zipf's rationale has largely been discredited, the principle still holds, and others have afforded it a more sound mathematical basis.</p>&#13;\n<p>You are to find all the words occurring <em>n</em> times in an English text. A word is a sequence of letters. Words are separated by non-letters. Capitalization should be ignored. A word can be of any length that an English word can be.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Input</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains a single positive integer <em>n</em>. Several lines of text follow which will contain no more than 10000 words. The text for each case is terminated by a single line containing EndOfText. EndOfText does not appear elsewhere in the input and is not considered a word.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Output</h3><p>For each test case, output the words which occur <em>n</em> times in the input text, one word per line, lower case, in alphabetical order. If there are no such words in input, output the following line:</p>&#13;\n<pre>There is no such word.&#13;\n</pre>&#13;\n<p>Leave a blank line between cases.</p><hr /><div id=\"sampleinputoutput\"><table class=\"inputoutput\"><tr><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Input</h3></td><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Output</h3></td></tr><tr></tr><tr class=\"inputoutput\"><td class=\"inputoutput\" valign=\"top\"><pre class=\"sampleio\">2&#13;\n&#13;\nIn practice, the difference between theory and practice is always&#13;\ngreater than the difference between theory and practice in theory.&#13;\n\t- Anonymous&#13;\n&#13;\nMan will occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of the&#13;\ntime he will pick himself up and continue on.&#13;\n        - W.
