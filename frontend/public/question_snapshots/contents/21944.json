The country was divided up into <em>N</em> regions (Auckland was region number 1, and Wellington number 13). A number, <em>m</em>, would be picked `at random', and the power would first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fairest starting point) and then in every m'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after <em>N</em>, and ignoring regions already turned off. For example, if <em>N</em> = 17 and <em>m</em> = 5, power would be turned off to the regions in the order:1,6,11,16,5,12,2,9,17,10,4,15,14,3,8,13,7.</p>&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem is that it is clearly fairest to turn off Wellington last (after all, that is where the Electricity headquarters are), so for a given <em>N</em>, the `random' number <em>m</em> needs to be carefully chosen so that region 13 is the last region selected.</p>&#13;\n<p>Write a program that will read in the number of regions and then determine the smallest number <em>m</em> that will ensure that Wellington (region 13) can function while the rest of the country is blacked out.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Input</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing the number of regions (<em>N</em>) with 13 &#8804; N &lt; 100. The file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single 0.</p>&#13;\n<p>&#160;</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Output</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the number <em>m</em> according to the above scheme.</p><hr /><div id=\"sampleinputoutput\"><table class=\"inputoutput\"><tr><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Input</h3></td><td class=\"SampleCaption\"><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Sample Output</h3></td></tr><tr></tr><tr class=\"inputoutput\"><td class=\"inputoutput\" valign=\"top\"><pre class=\"sampleio\">17&#13;\n0</pre></td><td class=\"inputoutput\" valign=\"top\"><pre class=\"sampleio\">7</pre></td></tr></table></div><hr /><table><tr><td>Source: </td><td>http://acm.uva.es/p/v1/151.html</td></tr><tr><td>Keyword:</td><td></td></tr></table></div></body>\n</html><html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></html>"}
