Got it? Smith's telephone number was 493-7775. This number can be written as the product of its prime factors in the following way:&#160;</span></p>&#13;\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><img src=\"/question_snapshots/assets/f6d0c6a8a3832d68a30bd25cf6d14178.gif\" alt=\"\\begin{displaymath}4937775 = 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 5\\cdot 65837\\end{displaymath}\" width=\"191\" height=\"27\" /></div>&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sum of all digits of the telephone number is&#160;4+9+3+7+7+7+5=42, and the sum of the digits of its prime factors is equally&#160;3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7=42. Wilansky was so amazed by his discovery that he named this type of numbers after his brother-in-law: Smith numbers.</p>&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As this observation is also true for every prime number, Wilansky decided later that a (simple and unsophisticated) prime number is not worth being a Smith number and he excluded them from the definition.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Description</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Wilansky published an article about Smith numbers in the&#160;</span><em>Two Year College Mathematics Journal</em><span>&#160;and was able to present a whole collection of different Smith numbers: For example, 9985 is a Smith number and so is 6036. However, Wilansky was not able to give a Smith number which was larger than the telephone number of his brother-in-law. It is your task to find Smith numbers which are larger than 4937775.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Input</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>The input consists of several test cases, the number of which you are given in the first line of the input.</span></p>&#13;\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Each test case consists of one line containing a single positive integer smaller than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p><h3 style=\"text-align:left\">Output</h3><p><span>For every input value&#160;</span><em>n</em><span>, you are to compute the smallest Smith number which is larger than&#160;</span><em>n</em><span>&#160;and print each number on a single line.
